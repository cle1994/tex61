   Snowboarding has been  around since the 1920s, when  people would tie
plywood or wooden  planks from barrels to their  feet using clotheslines
and  horse  reins  in  order  to steer  themselves  down  hills.  Modern
snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon,
Michigan, invented a toy for his daughter by fastening two skis together
and attaching a  rope to one end  so she would have some  control as she
stood on the board and  glided downhill. Dubbed the "snurfer" (combining
snow and surfer), the toy proved so popular among his daughter's friends
that  Poppen licensed  the  idea to  a manufacturer  that  sold about  a
million snurfers  over the next decade.  And, in 1966 alone  over half a
million snurfers were sold.

   In  the early  1970s,  Poppen organized  snurfing  competitions at  a
Michigan  ski  resort  that  attracted enthusiasts  from  all  over  the
country.  One  of those  early  pioneers  was  Tom  Sims, a  devotee  of
skateboarding (a sport born in the 1950s when kids attached roller skate
wheels to small  boards that they steered by shifting  their weight). As
an eighth grader in Haddonfield, New  Jersey, in the 1960s, Sims crafted
a snowboard in  his school shop class  by gluing carpet to the  top of a
piece of wood and attaching aluminum sheeting to the bottom. He produced
commercial snowboards in  the mid 70s. During this  same time, Dimitrije
Milovich—an  American surfing  enthusiast who  had also  enjoyed sliding
down snowy hills on cafeteria trays  during his college years in upstate
New York—constructed  a snowboard called "Winterstick,"  inspired by the
design and  feel of a  surfboard. Articles  about his invention  in such
mainstream magazines as Newsweek helped publicize the young sport.

   Also  during this  same period,  in  1977, Jake  Burton Carpenter,  a
Vermont native who  had enjoyed snurfing since the age  of 14, impressed
the  crowd at  a  Michigan  snurfing competition  with  bindings he  had
designed to  secure his feet  to the board.  That same year,  he founded
Burton Snowboards in Londonderry, Vermont. The "snowboards" were made of
wooden planks that were flexible and  had water ski foot traps. Very few
people  picked  up snowboarding  because  the  price  of the  board  was
considered  too high  at $38,  but  eventually Burton  would become  the
biggest  snowboarding company  in the  business. In  the spring  of 1976
Welsh skateboarders  Jon Roberts and  Pete Matthews developed  a Plywood
deck with foot bindings for use on the Dry Ski Slope at the school camp,
Ogmore-by-Sea, Wales. UK.  Further development of the  board was limited
as Matthews suffered serious injury  while boarding at Ogmore and access
for the  boarders was  declined following the  incident. The  'deck' was
much  shorter than  current snow  boards. Bevelled  edges and  a convex,
polyurethane  varnished  bottom to  the  board,  allowed quick  downhill
movement, but limited turning ability.
